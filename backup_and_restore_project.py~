# Brightway25: Backup and Restore Projects
## Author: Stew-McD
## Date: 27/05/2023

This Python script provides functionality for backing up and restoring a Brightway2 project directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `bw2data` and `bw2io` packages

## Usage

1. Clone or download the `backup_and_restore_project.py` script.
2. Open the script in a Python IDE or text editor.
3. Set the following variables to the project name, whether you want to backup or restore, the directory locations and the file name:
   - `project_name`
   - `backup`
   - `restore`
   - `delete_project`
   - `custom_project_dir`
   - `project_archive`
4. Run the script.

## Notes

- The script sets the environment variable to the current directory so that the backup is saved here.
- If you have/want a custom location for the bw2 project directory, set it in the `custom_project_dir` variable.
- The backup file is saved with the name: `brightway2-project-<project_name>-backup.<date-time>.tar.gz`.
- If the project already exists and you want to delete it before restoring, set the `delete_project` variable to `True`.
- If you want to change the backup file name, change the `project_archive` variable.
- The script was tested with Brightway2 version 3.7.2.
