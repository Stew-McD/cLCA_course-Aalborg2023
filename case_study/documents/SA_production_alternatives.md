## PRODUCTION

Commercial production
Historically, succinic acid was obtained from amber by distillation and has thus been known as spirit of amber. Common industrial routes include hydrogenation of maleic acid, oxidation of 1,4-butanediol, and carbonylation of ethylene glycol. Succinate is also produced from butane via maleic anhydride.[1] Global production is estimated at 16,000 to 30,000 tons a year, with an annual growth rate of 10%.[2]

Genetically engineered Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are proposed for the commercial production via fermentation of glucose.[3]

### Fermentation

Succinic acid can be produced from renewable resources via fermentation of glucose[4] through the following steps:

    Glucose is fermented to pyruvic acid via Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway (EMP).
    Pyruvic acid is converted to acetyl CoA and then to succinic acid via tricarboxylic acid (TCA) or citric acid cycle.
    Succinic acid is removed and used to make other products.

The overall process converts glucose into two succinic acid molecules, two CO2 molecules, and four ATP molecules. The overall process can be summarized as:

    C6H12O6 + 2 ADP + 2 Pi → 2 CH3COCOO− + 2 ATP + 2 H2O + 2 H+
    2 CH3COCOO− + 2 CoA + 2 NAD+ → 2 CH3CO-CoA + 2 CO2 + 2 NADH + 2 H+
    2 CH3CO-CoA + 2 ADP + 2 Pi → 2 succinate + 2 ATP + 2 CoA + 2 H2O

## USES

### Precursor to polymers, resins, and solvents
Succinic acid is a precursor to some polyesters and a component of some alkyd resins.[1] 1,4-Butanediol (BDO) can be synthesized using succinic acid as a precursor.[5] The automotive and electronics industries heavily rely on BDO to produce connectors, insulators, wheel covers, gearshift knobs and reinforcing beams.[6] Succinic acid also serves as the bases of certain biodegradable polymers, which are of interest in tissue engineering applications.[7]

Succinic acid is used in the food and beverage industry, primarily as an acidity regulator.[8] Global production is estimated at 16,000 to 30,000 tonnes a year, with an annual growth rate of 10% to 20%.[9] The growth can be attributed to advances in industrial biotechnology that seek to displace petroleum-based chemicals in industrial applications.[21] The global succinic acid market is estimated to reach USD 836.2 million by 2020, growing at a CAGR of 19.4% from 2014 to 2020.[22]

### Food and drugs

As a food additive and dietary supplement, succinic acid is generally recognized as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.[8] Succinic acid is used primarily as an acidity regulator[9] in the food and beverage industry. It is also available as a flavoring agent, contributing a somewhat sour and astringent component to umami taste.[3] As an excipient in pharmaceutical products, it is also used to control acidity[10] or as a counter ion.[3]
